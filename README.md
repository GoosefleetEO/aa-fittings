## Key Features

* Support for inputting fittings using the EFT format. 
  * Support for pulling fits from ESI *Coming Soon*
* Support for saving fits to EVE via ESI.

```

### 2. Configure AA settings

Configure your AA settings (`local.py`) as follows:

- Add `'fittings',` to `INSTALLED_APPS`

### 3. Finalize Install
